What I want to make:

An application that I can use to track maintenace on my vehicles. 

Features:

- A way to track a log of issues that I find wrong with the vehicle 
- A checklist of periodic checks (Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly) that need to be done on the vehicle
- A way to input a new vehicle that I want to track the maintenance of. (Done) 
- A way to search for parts on the vehicle that I need.
- Create a class to function as the initiation script? Like start with options that ask what you want to do? (Add vehicle, select vehicle, start PMCS, etc.) 


- Need to create a database to save the data that I input. 
- Create a way to log in and authenticate to pull up my user profile. 
- Connect the program to VIN checking API and list of vehicle parts. 
- Pull a list of manufacturer recalls on the vehicle?
